# GridLearn
GridLearn is a spin off of the open source OpenAI Gym environment CityLearn. Like CityLearn, GridLearn is a testbed for the implementation of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in building energy coordination and demand response in cities. GridLearn builds off of CityLearn by implementing power flow simulations in addition to aggregating the district's demand profiles. The current release of GridLearn implements all actions in parallel (Fig 1) -- future releases will consider alternate action selection (Fig 2).

## Description
Due to aging infrastructure and increasing penetration of PV, distribution networks are now facing voltage issues (both under- and overvoltages). To overcome voltage regulation issues grid operators have historically used capacitor banks to increase the voltage at different points of the feeder. However, as PV penetration rates rise and overvoltages become more prevelant this is not a viable solution. To that end many studies have been done on the efficacy of smart inverters and demand response to help perform voltage regulation.
## Requirements
CityLearn requires the installation of the following Python libraries:
- Pandas 0.24.2 or older
- Pandapower 2.0
- Numpy 1.16.4 or older
- Gym 0.14.0
- Json 2.0.9

In order to run the main files with the sample agent provided you will need:

### Building
The Building class is the main building block of the GridLearn environment.

The DHW and cooling demands of the buildings have been pre-computed and obtained from EnergyPlus. The DHW and cooling supply systems are sized such that the DHW and cooling demands are always satisfied. CityLearn automatically sets constraints to the actions from the controllers to guarantee that the DHW and cooling demands are satisfied, and that the building does not receive from the storage units more energy than it needs. 

The file building_attributes.json contains the attributes of each building, which can be modified. We do not advise to modify the attributes Building -> HeatPump -> nominal_power and Building -> ElectricHeater -> nominal_power from their default value "autosize", as they guarantee that the DHW and cooling demand are always satisfied.

The ```HeatPump``` is sized such that it will always be able to fully satisfy the heating and cooling demands of the building. This function also sizes the ```EnergyStorage``` devices, setting their capacity as 3 times the maximum hourly cooling demand in the simulated period.

### Heat pump
Its efficiency is given by the coefficient of performance (COP), which is calculated as a function of the outdoor air temperature and of the following parameters:

-```eta_tech```: technical efficiency of the heat pump

-```T_target```: target temperature. Conceptually, it is  equal to the logarithmic mean of the temperature of the supply water of the storage device and the temperature of the water returning from the building. Here it is assumed to be constant and defined by the user in the [building_attributes.json](/data/building_attributes.json) file.  For cooling, values between 7C and 10C are reasonable.
Any amount of cooling demand of the building that isn't satisfied by the ```EnergyStorage``` device is automatically supplied by the ```HeatPump``` directly to the ```Building```, guaranteeing that the cooling demand is always satisfied. The ```HeatPump``` is more efficient (has a higher COP) if the outdoor air temperature is lower, and less efficient (lower COP) when the outdoor temperature is higher (typically during the day time). On the other hand, the electricity demand is typically higher during the daytime and lower at night. ```cooling_energy_generated = COP*electricity_consumed, COP > 1```
#### Attributes
- ```cop_heating```: coefficient of performance for heating supply
- ```cop_cooling```:  coefficient of performance for cooling supply
- ```electrical_consumption_cooling```: electricity consumed for cooling supply (kWh)
- ```electrical_consumption_heating```: electricity consumed for heating supply (kWh)
- ```heat_supply```: heating supply (kWh)
- ```cooling_supply```: cooling supply (kWh)
#### Methods
- ```get_max_cooling_power()``` and ```get_max_heating_power()``` compute the maximum amount of heating or cooling that the heat pump can provide based on its nominal power of the compressor and its COP. 
- ```get_electric_consumption_cooling()``` and ```get_electric_consumption_heating()``` return the amount of electricity consumed by the heat pump for a given amount of supplied heating or cooling energy.
### Energy storage
Storage devices allow heat pumps to store energy that can be later released into the building. Typically every building will have its own storage device, but CityLearn also allows defining a single instance of the ```EnergyStorage``` for multiple instances of the class ```Building```, therefore having a group of buildings sharing a same energy storage device.

#### Attributes
- ```soc```: state of charge (kWh)
- ```energy_balance```: energy coming in (if positive) or out (if negative) of the energy storage device (kWh)

#### Methods
- ```charge()``` increases (+) or decreases (-) of the amount of energy stored. The input is the amount of energy as a ratio of the total capacity of the storage device (can vary from -1 to 1). Outputs the energy balance of the storage device.
## Environment variables

- ```t_in```: indoor temperature in Celcius degrees.
- ```avg_unmet_setpoint```: average difference between the indoor temperatures and the cooling temperature setpoints in the different zones of the building in Celcius degrees. sum((t_in - t_setpoint).clip(min=0) * zone_volumes)/total_volume
- ```rh_in```: indoor relative humidity in %.

- ```net_electricity_consumption```: net electricity consumption of the building (including all energy systems) in the current time step.
- ```absolute_voltage```: the per unit voltage at the nearest distribution bus
- ```total_voltage_spread```: the difference between the maximum and minimum voltage in the network
- ```relative_voltage```: the percentile ranking of the nearest bus's voltage

### Possible actions
C determines the capacity of the storage device and is defined as a multiple of the maximum thermal energy consumption by the building.
- ```cooling_storage```: increase (action > 0) or decrease (action < 0) of the amount of cooling energy stored in the cooling storage device. -1/C <= action <= 1/C (attempts to decrease or increase the cooling energy stored in the storage device by an amount equal to the action times the storage device's maximum capacity). In order to decrease the energy stored in the device (action < 0), the energy must be released into the building's cooling system. Therefore, the state of charge will not decrease proportionally to the action taken if the demand for cooling of the building is lower than the action times the maximum capacity of the cooling storage device.
- ```dhw_storage```: increase (action > 0) or decrease (action < 0) of the amount of DHW stored in the DHW storage device. -1/C <= action <= 1/C (attempts to decrease or increase the DHW stored in the storage device by an amount equivalent to action times its maximum capacity). In order to decrease the energy stored in the device, the energy must be released into the building. Therefore, the state of charge will not decrease proportionally to the action taken if the demand for DHW of the building is lower than the action times the maximum capacity of the DHW storage device.
- ```energy_storage```: increase (action > 0) or decrease (action < 0) of the amount of energy stored in a battery. Similarly the action is constrained by the available energy stored in the device and the remaining storage
- ```pv_curtail```: curtailment of solar power production.
- ```pv_phi```: change in phase lag of the inverter. Phi between 0 (completely skewed towards real power) and 90 degrees (completely skewed towards reactive power)

Note for storage actions that the action of the user-implemented controller can be bounded between -1/C and 1/C because the capacity of the storage unit, C, is defined as a multiple of the maximum thermal energy consumption by the building. For instance, if C_cooling = 3 and the peak cooling energy consumption of the building during the simulation is 20 kWh, then the storage unit will have a total capacity of 60 kWh.

The mathematical formulation of the effects of the actions can be found in the methods ```set_storage_heating(action)``` and ```set_storage_cooling(action)``` of the class Building in the file [energy_models.py](/energy_models.py).
### Reward function
The reward function must be defined by the user by changing the ```get_reward()``` method in the file [/citylearn/energy_models.py](/citylearn/energy_models.py?plain=1#L237).

By modifying these functions the user changes the reward that the CityLearn environment returns every time the method .step(a) is called.

### Performance metrics
These components have been depricated in favor of the ```scrape_data.ipynb``` file which can compare across any previously run data file.
